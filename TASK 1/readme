Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Clustering
Project Overview
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation, where we aim to divide customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and other key attributes from a grocery firmâ€™s database. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we identify similarities within customer groups, allowing the business to optimize its strategy for each segment, modify products according to customer needs, and address the concerns of different customer types effectively.

How to Run the Project
Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial marketing strategy that involves categorizing customers into different groups that reflect similar behaviors and preferences. This approach enables businesses to tailor their marketing, products, and services to meet the specific needs of each segment, increasing customer satisfaction and boosting profitability.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Segment the customer base of a grocery firm using unsupervised clustering techniques.
Optimize customer engagement by identifying key behaviors and preferences in each segment.
Provide actionable insights that can help modify products and services according to the distinct needs of the identified customer segments.
Data
The dataset includes customer records from a grocery firm's database with key features such as:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Purchase History: Records of purchases made by customers.
Demographic Information: Customer age, location, etc.
Spending Patterns: How much customers typically spend.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values.
Normalizing/Standardizing data.
Feature engineering to create meaningful attributes.
Unsupervised Clustering:
K-Means Clustering: Applied to segment customers into meaningful clusters based on similarities.
Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster Analysis:
Analyzing each cluster to understand the characteristics of the customers in each segment.
Deriving insights on how to cater to each cluster's specific needs.
Results
Cluster Profiles: Each cluster represents a unique customer segment, such as high spenders, frequent buyers, budget-conscious customers, etc.
Business Recommendations: Insights provided for optimizing product offerings, promotions, and personalized marketing strategies for each customer segment.
Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: Unsupervised clustering (K-Means).
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and analysis.
Conclusion
This customer segmentation project offers actionable insights to the grocery firm by classifying its customers into distinct groups. The segmentation allows the business to tailor products and services more effectively to meet the specific needs of each group, enhancing customer satisfaction and improving overall business performance.
