# Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Clustering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation**, where we aim to divide customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and other key attributes from a grocery firmâ€™s database. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we identify similarities within customer groups, allowing the business to optimize its strategy for each segment, modify products according to customer needs, and address the concerns of different customer types effectively.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial marketing strategy that involves categorizing customers into different groups that reflect similar behaviors and preferences. This approach enables businesses to tailor their marketing, products, and services to meet the specific needs of each segment, increasing customer satisfaction and boosting profitability.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Segment the customer base of a grocery firm using unsupervised clustering techniques.
- Optimize customer engagement by identifying key behaviors and preferences in each segment.
- Provide actionable insights that can help modify products and services according to the distinct needs of the identified customer segments.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Unsupervised clustering (K-Means).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis.

## Conclusion

This customer segmentation project offers actionable insights to the grocery firm by classifying its customers into distinct groups. The segmentation allows the business to tailor products and services more effectively to meet the specific needs of each group, enhancing customer satisfaction and improving overall business performance.
